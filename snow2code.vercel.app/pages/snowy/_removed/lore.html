                                Snowy's native language is uniquely her own, referred to as "Bottom." This language is entirely private, with no one else understanding it except her boyfriend, Cone. Despite this, Snowy primarily communicates in English. She also has a basic understanding of several other languages, including Russian, German, Spanish, and Polish. While not fluent, Snowy enjoys learning these languages and occasionally uses phrases in them during conversation.

                                Snowy suspects she may have Persistent Depressive Disorder (PDD), a long-term form of depression. This ongoing struggle shapes how Snowy navigates her day-to-day life, often leaving her at a loss for words or struggling with slow reaction times, especially during emotionally taxing moments such as breakups.

                                Snowy has two distinct personalities, often influenced by her mood and environment:

                                <br><br>
                                <b><p id="censorship">"Fuck everyone~"</b>: A freer, more chaotic side that reflects her potential pansexuality. In this mode, Snowy is playful, spontaneous, and less inhibited. She embraces the moment without overthinking, letting her sillier nature shine.</p>

                                Snowy's origins are wrapped in mystery, as elusive as the stars herself . Though she have been part of the Furry Fandom for some time, even Snowy doesn’t know when she first got involved. This adds to her air of intrigue, especially since she prefer to go by "Snow," "Snowy," or "Lyn Snow," avoiding her birth name altogether. Snowy's love for cats has always been a core part of her identity—cats are her quiet companions, and Snowy finds joy in her calming presence.

                                Snowy cleans herself in two ways:
                                
                                <br><br>Like a cat: By licking. This method is effective, but because of Snowy's ADHD, she often overdo it until her fluff is entirely wet. During this time, Snowy doesn’t look fluffy at all.
                                <br>With baths: While effective, baths often leave Snowy’s fluff wet for extended periods, even after attempting to dry off.

                                From an early age, Snowy was diagnosed with ADHD. However, it is now believed this may have been a misdiagnosis, as Snowy does not exhibit typical ADHD symptoms. Instead, it seems more likely that Snowy is autistic. Known for being fluffy, cute, and full of energy, Snowy's introverted and shy nature often leads her  to prefer solitude, both in real life and in gaming. While she enjoy alone time, Snowy dislikes complete isolation, seeking an escape from overwhelming crowds. her love of technology and computers provides both a creative outlet and a comforting space, where Snowy can immerse herself  in programming and tech, finding joy in solving complex problems and creating new things.

                                Snowy identifies as aroace (aromantic and asexual), which shapes how she view relationships and connections with others. This part of her identity means she value deep, meaningful friendships and companionship over traditional romance. Snowy doesn't feel romantic attraction but expresses love and affection in her own unique ways, especially through actions rather than words. her relationships are rooted in mutual trust and respect, allowing her  to connect deeply with people like Cone, her romantic partner.

                                While Snowy is affectionate with those she trust, she are particular about personal space. Snowy prefers people other than Cone to ask before doing anything that involves touching her tail, body, or nose. This includes head pats, boops, hugs, or petting. With Cone, these gestures bring comfort and grounding, but with others, Snowy values the respect of being asked first. Snowy appreciates physical affection but prefers to keep it within comfortable boundaries unless explicitly invited.
    
                                <br><br>Snowy also dislikes being picked up without permission and would prefer if people asked first. This boundary is part of her need to feel in control of her space and body.

                                Snowy can be flustered at times, whether it’s with friends like Fox and Derp, or even Cone, her romantic partner. This flustered nature adds to Snowy's innocent charm, but at times, she are completely unfazed by things that might embarrass others. Snowy is easily confused too, especially when faced with tricky questions or situations she can’t immediately grasp. Whether it’s playful teasing from friends or a moment that catches her  off-guard, Snowy’s reactions are always endearing, even if she don’t always understand what’s going on right away.

Though shy and unable to openly flirt, her relationship is full of deep affection. Sometimes she nervously say things like, "You own me :3" or "I give you my full permission to do whatever you want to me," though these moments are rare due to Snowy's reserved nature. Cone’s physical gestures—pats, boops, and hugs—bring Snowy comfort and grounding, especially during moments of emotional turmoil. Even though Snowy often appears distant or unengaged, this is sometimes a reflection of her struggles rather than a lack of care. Snowy needs reassurance, even when she don’t ask for it outright, and finds solace in Cone’s affection.

                                        Snowy’s body hides many secrets beneath its snow-white fluff. Her appearance often shifts depending on her emotional state, but her fur is usually a pure snow-white, though it sometimes changes. On rare occasions, her fur can take on dark green hues, but this isn’t often seen. More commonly, her pristine coat becomes stained with streaks of red—a haunting symbol of self-inflicted harm and emotional turmoil. These red marks appear far more frequently than the green, acting as a visual reminder of Snowy’s internal struggles.

                                        <br><br>Underneath Snowy’s fluffy fur, scars and injuries—some self-inflicted—are hidden. Only those close enough to stroke her fur in certain ways might uncover these wounds. The most visible scar is the one given by Cone, the mark from a bite that zombified Snowy, symbolizing her deep connection with Cone. On Snowy's good days, her fur remains untouched and snow-white, a symbol of her resilience and calm.

                                Snowy's tail is a source of both comfort and mischief. she often use it to wrap herself up for warmth, or to comfort herself when she is feeling down. However, despite its cozy appearance, Snowy still tends to feel cold at times. When annoyed, Snowy isn't afraid to use her tail as a weapon, giving a good whack to anyone who gets on her nerves. Despite this, Snowy is still trying (and failing) to catch her own tail in her paws, constantly questioning whether it's as fluffy as it looks.

                                Snowy is now confirmed to be female and identifies as an Arctic Fox. In the past, Snowy considered transitioning from female to male but ultimately decided against it, as "it didn’t feel like it was meant for her." Snowy also contemplated identifying as pansexual but remains uncertain, leaning on self-discovery as part of her journey.
                                <br><br>Snowy identifies as Aroace, Grey Asexual, and Grey Aromantic but is open about exploring different facets of her identity. She is fine with any pronouns, including she/her, despite identifying as female.

                                Despite her struggles, Snowy’s silly and chaotic side often shines through. she are known for making playful statements like, "If I eat a glow stick, will I glow? :3," and are fond of foxes, snow, and her giant Calico cat plushie, which she cuddle while sleeping. Snowy loves creating harmless chaos, always respecting boundaries—especially Cone’s. her playful nature also includes a deep love for all things related to computers and technology. Snowy enjoys building, repairing, and coding, finding joy in understanding how machines and systems work.

                                <br><br>Snowy is also unsure if she could die from eating chocolate, often wondering whether her curiosity will get the better of her . Interestingly, she tends to feel odd the day after eating chocolate or even on the same day. This feeling can last for a few days, and it's unclear why it happens. This playful uncertainty adds to her already chaotic and silly personality.

                                In her younger years, Snowy had a habit of stealing small, low-value items, often taking things like coins or lost items at school. This mischievous streak is now just a part of her past, but it hints at her early chaotic tendencies.

                                A while after meeting Fox, Derply, and Cone in Team Fortress 2: Zombie Escape, Snowy attempted to leave the Furry Fandom. However, like many have joked, 'You can never leave the Furry Fandom.' This attempt was short-lived, and Snowy returned, more invested than ever.
