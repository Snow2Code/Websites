<h1>Snowy Fox Fortress // SFF</h1>


<br><br>


<p>Snowy Fox Fortress (or just SFF) is a custom TF2 server handcrafted for a specific flavor of chaos. It’s not public. It’s not mass-market. It’s a curated, tweaked, and very intentional experience.</p>

<p>Built from the bones of SourceMod, run by a single dev (hi, I’m Snow2Code), and constantly being experimented on.</p>

<p>This isn’t a plug-and-play experience. You’ll find:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Custom balance tweaks (probably)</li>
    <li>Modified maps (probably)</lI>
    <li>Many maps.. that also take donkeys years to download</lI>
    <li>Plugin experiments</li>
    {* Wild test builds *}
    <li>A server crash or two (don’t worry, I’ll fix it.. probably)</li>
</ul>

<p>This project exists because I love TF2, and I wanted a space where I could mess with the game without randos screwing it up. Think of it as a private dev playground… with explosions.</p>
