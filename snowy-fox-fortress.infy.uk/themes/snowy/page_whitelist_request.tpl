<p>Whitelisting is required to join the Snowy Fox Fortress server.</p>

<p>This isn’t a public playground. It’s a curated space. If you’re here, you probably already know what it is — and maybe even know me. If not, you can still apply. Just don’t expect a guaranteed “yes.”</p>

<p>I reserve the right to ghost you if you’re annoying.</p>

<p>Fill out the form honestly. Keep it short. Keep it respectful.</p>

Both pieces of software will record your game 24/7 with little to no impact on your game and you simply press a keybind to record the last X amount of minutes of gameplay which is perfect for catching rule breakers.<br /><br /> Alternatively, you can use the old method of using demos. While you are spectating the offending player, press the ` key on your keyboard to show the Developers Console. If this does not show, you will need to go into your Game Settings and enable this. Then type `record [demoname]` and hit enter, the file will then be in your mod folder of your game directory.', 'blue', '', true);">here</a> for an explanation.<br /><br />

<b>Do I have to give this infomation?</b><br />
Most of it you do not. But email and ProfileID is needed so you are able to be contacted on steam or email if you've been accepted or denied.<br><br>
Note:<br>
ProfileID is STRICTLY required so you are able to be added to the whitelist.
